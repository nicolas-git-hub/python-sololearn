# The built-in function map an filter are very useful higher-order functions that operate
# on lists (or similar objects called iterables).
# The function map takes a function and an iterable as arguments, and returns a new iterable
# with the function applied to each argument.
#
# Example:

def add_five(x):
    return x + 5

nums = [11, 22, 33, 44, 55]
result = list(map(add_five, nums))
print(result)

#
# We could have archived the same result more easily by using lambda syntax.

print('\n')

result = list(map(lambda x: x + 5, nums))
print(result)

#
# To convert the result into a list, we used list explicitly.
