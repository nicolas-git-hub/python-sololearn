Data Structures

As we have sen in the previous lessons, Python supports the following data structures:
lists, dictionaries, tuples, sets

When to use a dictionary:
========================

 - When you need a logical assosiation between a key:value pair.
 - When you need fast lookup for your data based on a custom key.
 - When your data is being constanly modified.

Remember, dictionaries are mutable.


When to use the other types:
============================

 - Use list if you have a collection of data that doesn't need random access.
Try to choose lists when you need a simple itarable collection that is modified frequently.
 - Use a set if you need uniqueness for the elements.
 - Use tuples when your data cannot change.



Many times a tuple is used in combination with a dictionary
For example, a tuple might represent a key, because it's immutable.
