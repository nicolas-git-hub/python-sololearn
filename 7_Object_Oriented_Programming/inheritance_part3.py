# Inheritance can also be indirect.
# One class can inherit from another, and that class can inherit from a third class.
#
# Example:

class A:
    def method(self):
        print('A method')

class B(A):
    def another_method(self):
        print('B method')

class C(B):
    def third_method(self):
        print('C method')

c = C()
c.method()
c.another_method()
c.third_method()

# However, circular inheritane is not possible.
