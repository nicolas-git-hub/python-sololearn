# You can use Python to read and write the content of files.
# Text files are the easiest to manipulate.
# Before a file can be edited, it must be opened, using the open function.

my_file	= open("txt/filename.txt")

# The argument of the open function is the path to the file.
# If the file is in the same directory as the program, you can specify
# only its name.
